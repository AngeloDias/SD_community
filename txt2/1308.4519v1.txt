intrinsically related to the adoption of the unique VBS ground
state, since it gives rise to four, rather than one, independent Cu--Cu superexchange pathways15. This contrasts with the longrange antiferromagnetic order seen in the other family members.

the aristotype unit cell (Rhomb-1) common to Cs2ZrCu3F12 and
Cs2SnCu3F12; yellow outline is the doubled cell (Rhomb-2) found for
Rb2SnCu3F12.

Considering these differences it is of interest to probe the
structural behaviour of Rb2SnCu3F12 at low temperature, in order
to compare and contrast to the structural and magnetic behaviour
of Cs2ZrCu3F12.
The target compound was synthesised by an adaptation of the
previously reported procedure14. RbF (Sigma Aldrich 99.8 %)
and SnF4 (Sigma Aldrich) were dried at 120 °C under vacuum for
approximately 20 hours. They were then mixed and ground with
CuF2 (Sigma Aldrich 98%) under argon in the molar
stoichiometric ratio 2:1:3 before sealing in a gold tube. The tube
was then heated under flowing argon at 10 °C min-1 to 600 °C for
twelve hours before cooling at the same rate. In the case of single
crystals the molar ratio was adjusted to 3:2:3 (in order to provide
a flux for crystal growth), the temperature to increased 800 °C
and the cooling rate slowed to ~ 3 °C hr-1. In all cases it was very
difficult to synthesise the pure Rb2SnCu3F12 phase, with
significant impurities being Rb2SnF6 and CuO. In the powder
diffraction experiments we were able to adequately account for
these using multiphase Rietveld refinements16,17 – see ESI for
further details.

Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction experiments were
performed at beamline I11, Diamond Light Source18. In this first
experiment (Run 1), data were recorded at room temperature
before quickly cooling to 100 K and allowing equilibration,
before increasing the temperature. The room temperature data
were well fitted by the proposed Rhomb-2 model (large cell,
Figure 1; space group R-3, with a ~ 13.9 Å, c ~ 20.3 Å)
previously derived from single crystal data14. Specifically it was
confirmed that the doubling of the aristotype unit cell was
required. At around 250 K – on cooling – however, it was found
that visible splittings occurred in some of the diffraction peaks.
There are two possible causes of these splittings: a phase
separation to two very similar phases, or a phase transition to a
single, lower symmetry phase. A thermally-induced phase
separation has recently been reported in the multiferroic fluoride
KxFeF319. In the present case, the simplest model was tested: ie
two Rhomb-2 like phases with differing lattice parameters and
phase fractions. This model failed to account for the observed
splittings. Initial modelling using a single lower symmetry phase
was attempted using a monoclinic model which had previously
been derived for the Cs2ZrCu3F12 system12; however, this was
unable to explain some superstructure peaks necessitated by the
‘doubled’ cell. By considering the possible distortions of the
parent phase (using the ISODISTORT program20) a triclinic
model was found to account for all the observed peaks (see ESI
for full details). This model (a maximal non-isomorphic subgroup
of Rhomb-2) provides the most plausible explanation of the
observed data. However, due to its complexity, and the issues of
sample purity, it was not possible to refine full details of this
model; nevertheless, high-quality fits were obtained by refining
only the lattice and profile parameters. Further cooling – to
approximately 190 K – leads to the disappearance of this splitting
and a return to a pattern which is well fitted by the Rhomb-2
model (Fig. 2 and 4). In order to probe this phenomenon further,
and to confirm that this apparent re-entrant phase transition is not
an artefact due to sluggish kinetics, the experiment was repeated,
this time using both heating and slow-cooling cycles (Run 2). The
sample was cooled slowly from 300 K to 165 K (below the
suggested transition) and heated to 300 K again, with several data
collections carried out during each ramp. In this case it was
found that – visually at least – there was a clear transition from
the Rhomb-2 to the triclinic phase, and back to the Rhomb-2
phase on both heating and cooling. Rietveld refinement showed a
hysteresis in the phase transition temperature and a mixed-phase
zone in both directions, both suggestive that the phase transition
is 1st order in nature.
To obtain a definitive structure for the intermediate triclinic
phase and to investigate the relationship between the low
temperature and room temperature rhombohedral phases, single
crystal X-ray diffraction was performed. Data were collected on
two separate crystals. In the first experiment a crystal was
mounted at 220 K. After data collection, the crystal was warmed
to 300 K, cooled to 230 K and then warmed to 245 K. To our
surprise, all three datasets, collected at 220, 230 and 245 K were
indexable and refined well in the Rhomb-2 model, with R-factors
of around 5% in each case (see ESI for details). It was also
found that the previously reported structural disorder was present

at all three temperatures. In a second single crystal experiment
data were collected at 300, 245 and 140 K on cooling: in this case
the quality of the refinement using the same Rhomb-2 model was
inferior at 140 K to that at 245 K (R1 values of 5.62% and 3.49%,
respectively). Significantly, there was no evidence for loss of
three-fold symmetry, however, re-integrating the 140 K data in a
much larger and lower symmetry unit cell (model ‘Trig-1’, space
group P-3, a ~ 27.8 Å, c ~ 20.3 Å) , as tentatively suggested by
Matan et al.15, did reveal some evidence for additional very weak
scattering in the enlarged cell. The weakness of these possible
superlattice reflections precluded any reasonable refinement. We
re-iterate that this enlarged, but high-symmetry, unit cell does not
account for the peak splittings seen in the intermediate (triclinic)
phase in our powder experiments.
In order to further explore the reproducibility of the powder
experiments an analogous experiment was carried out using
powder neutron diffraction (see ESI for details). It was found
that further refinement for full structural details was prohibited

temperatures. In this case only single Rb2SnCu3F12 phases were used
(Rhomb-2 model at 300 and 165 K, triclinic model (P-1) at 220 K. Red
tick-marks correspond to Rb2SnCu3F12, orange to Rb2SnF12 and blue to
RbCuF3.

due to impurity levels but at room temperature and 150 K the
pattern was successfully fitted in the Rhomb-2 model and at 220
K in the triclinic cell. This confirmed the essential behaviour
proposed in the synchrotron powder experiments.
From the present study it is clear that powder samples of
Rb2SnCu3F12 show curious and hitherto unreported phase
transition behaviour. The reproducible transition from
rhombohedral to triclinic to rhombohedral phases on cooling and
re-heating strongly suggests a re-entrant structural phase
transition. Unfortunately, the exact details of each crystal
structure cannot be ascertained from the powder diffraction data
alone, and both the present and previous single crystal studies
clearly show behaviour different to all the present powder-based
studies. In particular it is not clear whether the two ‘Rhomb-2’
phases surrounding the triclinic phase are truly identical or
whether they differ, for example, in the degree or nature of the
fluoride disordering.
Purely structural re-entrant phase transitions in crystalline
materials are very rare. A recent study suggests only three known
examples21; this has now been supplemented by one further
possible case22. Interestingly, in the latter case, the transformation
has the same group-subgroup relationship (R-3 to P-1) as
presented here, though it is suggested that the transition is due to
competition between a weak Jahn-Teller effect and magnetic
ordering; in our case the cause is more likely to be purely
structural and related to the fluorine disorder.

Conclusions
12

In conclusion we have found that the frustrated kagome
magnet Rb2SnCu3F12 shows an unusual, apparently re-entrant,
structural phase transition below ambient temperature. This
transition occurs reproducibly in powder form, but not in single
crystals, suggesting that it is sluggish and particle/domain size
dependent. An alternative, but we suggest less likely, explanation
might be differences in stoichiometry between powder and single
crystal samples: we have no evidence for this, but cannot rule it
out due to the impurity problems in the powder sample. Although
the full crystal structure of Rb2SnCu3F12 has not been reported at
sub-ambient temperature, the previous study of Matan15 suggests
single crystal diffraction evidence of a structural phase transition
near 215 K. Moreover, a solid state 63,65Cu NMR study23 suggests
the presence of four distinct Cu sites at 5.2 K, which the authors
tentatively suggest is related to the transition near 215 K. The
present study does not rule out such a phase transition, in single
crystal form only, but the behaviour of the powder form is
certainly different.
In the light of this work, further
characterisation and comparison of the magnetic behaviour of
single crystal versus powder samples is prompted.
