Abstract
We show how to reduce the process of predicting conditional quantiles (and the median in particular) to solving classification. The accompanying theoretical statement shows that the regret
of the classifier bounds the regret of the quantile regression under a quantile loss. We also
test this reduction empirically against existing
quantile regression methods on large real-world
datasets and discover that it provides state-of-theart performance.

1 Introduction
Regression is the problem of estimating a mapping from
some feature space X to a real-valued output Y , given a
finite sample of the form (x, y) drawn from a distribution
D over X × Y . Typically, the goal of regression is to minimize the squared-error loss over the distribution D, that
is, E(x,y)∼D (y − f (x))2 . One standard justification for
this form of regression is that the minimizer is the mean:
f ∗ (x) = Ey∼D|x [y].

sons for doing quantile regression as opposed or in addition
to typical regression include:
1. Quantiles tend to behave well under noise. For instance, the median (i.e. the 1/2-quantile) equals the
mean under Gaussian noise, but the median is often inherently more robust to heavy tailed and non-Gaussian
noise;
2. As mentioned above, many important practical problems are naturally expressed in terms of quantiles. For
instance, wallet estimation – e.g. estimating the potential amount of money a customer can spend on computer hardware, as opposed to the expected amount –
can be done by looking at the conditional upper quantiles of expenditures [10, 9]. Quantile regression also
been applied to many other problems in Econometrics,
Sociology and Ecology, among other fields [5, 6];
3. The actual distribution of conditional noise can be estimated as required for some applications [8] using
quantile regression.

However, there are many important applications for which
mean estimates are either irrelevant or insufficient, and
quantiles (also known as general order statistics) are the
main quantities of interest. For instance, consider trying
to assess the risk of a business proposal. Estimates of the
lower quantiles of the conditional return distribution would
give a better indication of how worthwhile the proposal is
than a simple estimate of the mean return (which could be
too high because of very unlikely high profits).

This paper shows that the quantile regression problem can
be reduced to classification. The Quanting algorithm that
we introduce takes as input an instance of quantile regression and outputs a family of classification problems such
that solving the latter problems with small average error
leads to a provably accurate estimate of the conditional
quantile. Reducing quantile to classification automatically
gives us access to a large array of quantile regression methods, since the reduction applies to any existing or future
classification method.

The process of estimating the quantiles of a conditional distribution is known as quantile regression. More specifically, the goal of quantile regression is to obtain estimates
on the q-quantiles of the conditional distribution D|x. Intuitively, q-quantiles for different q describe different segments of the conditional distribution D|x and thus offer
more refined information about the data at hand. Other rea-

We compare empirically the Quanting algorithm with other
methods for quantile regression in the literature. Koenker
[5] has developed a linear quantile regression method,
while Takeuchi et al.[11] have recently devised a kernelbased quantile estimation method. Our approach, which is
intrinsically non-linear and conceptually simpler, compares
favorably with the existing alternatives in our experiments.

2 Basic Details
The quantile regression problem is defined in a setting
where we have a measure D over a set of features X and
real-valued outputs Y .
Definition 1 (Conditional q-quantile) Let 0 ≤ q ≤ 1
f = f (x) is a conditional q-quantile (or conditional qorder statistic) for D if for (D-almost every) x ∈ X
D(y ≤ f (x)|x) ≥ q and D(y ≥ f (x)|x) ≥ 1 − q. The
1/2-quantile is also known as the median.
Note that the q-quantile may not be unique when the conditional distribution has regions with zero mass.
2.1 Optimization
It is well-known that the optimal estimator for the absoluteerror loss is a median [6]. In other words, we have that for
every regression problem D,
arg min Ex,y∼D |y − f (x)| is a (conditional) median.
f

This can be verified by considering two equal point masses
at locations y1 and y2 . The absolute value loss for a point
y ∈ [y1 , y2 ] is (y − y1 ) + (y2 − y) = (y2 − y1 ) which is
constant independent of y; whereas any y 6∈ [y1 , y2 ] yields
a larger value. Since we can take any distribution over y
and break into equal mass pairs with y2 above and y1 below
the median, the absolute-error loss is minimized when f (x)
is a median.
The generalization of absolute-error loss for arbitrary order
statistics is the quantile loss function, also known as “pin-

The correctness of this can be (again) seen by considering
two points y1 and y2 with probability ratio 1−q
q ; or by noting that the result is implied by equation (3) in the proof of
Lemma 1 (the integral is positive unless Q(x) = q(x) or
D(y < t|x) = q for all t between Q(x) and q(x)).

3 An Algorithm
In this section and the next, we assume that we are given
samples (x, y) from a distribution D, where 0 ≤ y ≤ 1
(if this is not the case, we can re-normalize the data).
Given these samples, our proposed algorithm, which we
call Quanting, estimates the qth quantile of the conditional
distribution D|x using any importance weighted classification algorithm A. In fact, using an extra reduction discussed in Corollary 1 below, one can also do Quanting via
an unweighted binary classification algorithm, but we defer
any further discussion of this to the next section.
The Quanting algorithm has two parts. Algorithm 1 receives a set of training examples S of the form (x, y) and
a quantile q as input and uses algorithm A to compute a
family of binary classifiers ct . We assume that algorithm
A receives as input a set of training examples of the form
(x, y, w) where w is a weight and attempts to minimize the
weighted error. In the algorithm, positive examples receive
weight q while negative examples receive weight (1 − q).
Using the classifiers ct , Algorithm 2 produces a prediction
of the q-quantile for each x in a test set S 0 , in precisely
the same manner as the Probing algorithm for estimating
conditional class probabilities using 0/1 classifiers [7].
The essential idea of Quanting is also similar to Probing.
Each ct attempts to answer the question “is the q-quantile
above or below t?” In the (idealized) scenario where A
is perfect, one would have ct (x) = 1 if and only if t ≤

R q(x)
dt = q(x) exactly. Our analysis shows that if the
0
error of A is small on average over t, the quantile estimate
is accurate.
We note in passing that in reality, one cannot find a different
classifier for each t ∈ [0, 1]. Constructing classifiers ct for
t in a discrete mesh {0, 1/n, 2/n, . . . , (n − 1)/n, 1} will
add a 1/n term to the error bound.

4 Quanting Reductions Analysis
The Lemma we prove next relates the average regret of the
classifiers ct (how well the classifiers do in comparison to
how well they could do) to the regret of the quantile loss
incurred by the Quanting algorithm. For each x, the output
produced by the quanting algorithm is denoted by Q(x),
whereas q(x) is a correct q-quantile. In this analysis, we
use the standard one-classifier trick [7]: instead of learning
different classifiers, we learn one classifier c = {ct } with
an extra feature t used to index classifier ct .
Lemma 1 (Quanting Regret Transform) For all D, c,

We will show that e(D, c) − minc0 e(D, c0 ) is at least this
last expression. The expected importance-weighted error

qEx [y] + Ex 0
[D(y < t|x) − q]dt. (5)
Here only the last line is non-trivial, and it follows from
the fact that D(y < t|x) − q is increasing in t. Thus the
smallest possible value for the integral in (4) is achieved by
placing as much “weight” ct (x) as possible on the smallR1
est t while respecting the constraints 0 ct (x) dt = Q(x)
and 0 ≤ ct (x) ≤ 1. This corresponds precisely to setting
ct (x) = I(t ≤ Q(x)), from which (5) follows.
On can show that the inequality (5) is in fact an equality
when instead of {ct } we use the (optimal) classifiers

Ex,y∼D [lq (y, Q(x))] − Ex,y∼D [lq (y, q(x))]

and substitute q(x) for Q(x). Therefore,

where e(D, c) is the expected importance weighted binary
loss of c over D.

given by eqn. (1):

using (3). This finishes the proof.
We now show how to reduce q-quantile estimation to unweighted binary classification using the results of previous
work [2]. We apply rejection sampling: we feed the unweighted classifier samples of the form ((x, t), I(y ≥ t)),
each of the samples being independently discarded with
probability 1 − w(I(y ≥ t)), where w(b) = qb + (1 −
q)(1 − b) is the example’s weight. Notice that by [2, Theorem 2.3], sample complexity is not significantly affected
by this.

and unweighted binary classifier c = {ct }, let D̃ be the
distribution produced by rejection sampling. Then

Proof: Let ĉ = {ĉt }t be the importance-weighted classifiers induced by the rejection sampling procedure. A folk
theorem [2] implies that
e(D, ĉ) − minĉ0 e(D, ĉ0 ) = e(D̃, c) − minc0 e(D̃, c0 )
and the result follows from Lemma 1.

5 Related Work
A standard technique for quantile regression that has been
developed and extensively applied in the Econometrics
community [6] is linear quantile regression. In linear quantile regression, we assume that the conditional quantile
function is a linear function of the features of the form βx
and we estimate the parameters β̂ that minimize the quantile loss function (Equation 1). It can be shown that this
minimization is a linear programming problem and that it
can be efficiently solved using interior point techniques [5].
Implementations of linear quantile regression are available
in standard statistical analysis packages such as R and SAS.
The obvious limitation of linear quantile regression is that
the assumption of a linear relationship between the explanatory variables and the conditional quantile function
may not be true. Recently, Takeuchi et al. have recently
proposed a technique for nonparametric quantile estimation [11] that applies the two standard features of kernel
methods to conditional quantile estimation: regularization
and the kernel trick. They show that a regularized version
of the quantile loss function can be directly minimized using standard quadratic programming techniques. By choosing an appropriate kernel, such as a radial basis function
kernel, one can obtain nonlinear conditional quantile estimates. They compare their method experimentally to linear
quantile regression and to a nonlinear spline approach suggested by Koenker [5] on many small datasets for different
quantiles and find that it performs the best in most cases.

6 Experiments
Here we compare experimentally the Quanting algorithm to
the two existing methods for quantile regression described
in section 5: linear quantile regression and kernel quantile
regression.
We compare the methods on three different performance
metrics:
1. The quantile loss (Equation 1).
2. The percentage of examples for which the prediction
f (x) exceeds the actual value y, which should be close
to the quantile q for which we are optimizing.

3. The running time (Pentium 1.86GHz, 1.00GB RAM).
As base classifier learners for Quanting, we use two algorithms available in the WEKA machine learning software [13]: the J48 decision tree learner and logistic regression. For both methods, we use the default parameters provided by WEKA. We use rejection sampling to
perform importance-weighted classification with standard
unweighted classifiers. We use an adaptive discretization
scheme to choose the thresholds t in algorithm 1, the same
scheme that we use in the Probing reduction [7]. We fix the
number of classifiers at 100 for all the datasets.
For the kernel quantile regression, we have followed the
same experimental setup as described by Takeuchi et al.
[11]. We use a radial basis function kernel and choose
its radius and the regularization parameter using crossvalidation on the training data. We also scale the features
and the label to have zero mean and a standard deviation
of 1, as required for kernel methods. When predicting, we
convert the label back to the original scale to compute the
quantile loss.
As our benchmarks, we use four large, publicly available
datasets, from real-world domains where quantile regression is clearly applicable:
1. Adult: available from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository [4] as a classification dataset. The data was
originally extracted from the Census Bureau Database
and describes individual demographic characteristics
of such as age, education, sex and occupation. For
the original dataset, the objective is to predict a label
that indicates whether or not the individual’s income is
above $50K. We have retrieved the original numerical
income values from the Census Bureau Database and
used the income as the dependent variable in the quantile regression. Our objective is to predict the quantiles
of the conditional income distribution, which is useful
if we want to determine what is a low or a high income
for a given individual.
2. KDD-Cup 1998: available from the UCI KDD
Archive [3]. This dataset consists of records of individuals who have made a donation in the past to
a particular charity. Each example consists of attributes describing each individual’s donation history
over a series of donation campaigns, as well as demographic information, such as income and age. The dependent variable is the individual’s donation amount
in the most recent donation campaign. The original
dataset contains 95412 training records and 96367 test
records, but only 5% of the individuals donated in
the current campaign. Our objective is to predict the
quantiles of the conditional donation amount for individuals who donate. For this reason, we only use
4843 donor examples in the training set and the 4876

donor examples in the test set. Predicting quantiles
of the conditional donation distribution is important
for “anchoring”, i.e., deciding how much to suggest
as possible donation values when soliciting donations.
Anchoring is a well-established concept in marketing,
see, for example, [12].
3. California Housing: available from the StatLib repository [1]. It contains data on California housing characteristics aggregated at the block level (a sample block
group on average includes 1425.5 individuals living
in a geographically compact area). The independent
variables are median income, housing median age,
total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households,
latitude, and longitude. The dependent variable is
the median house value. Our objective is to predict
the quantiles of the conditional house value distribution. This information is very valuable for house
sellers and buyers, since it indicates what would be
a ‘lower bound’ and an ‘upper bound’ on the house
value, given its characteristics.
4. Boston Housing: available from the StatLib repository
[1]. It contains data on Boston housing characteristics
and values. The prediction task is analogous to the
one described for the California Housing dataset.
Table 1 shows the number of features and the number of
examples for each dataset. We use the standard train/test
splits for training and testing. Because the kernel quantile regression method has very high memory and computational time requirements, we could not run it using all the
examples in the training set for the Adult, KDD-Cup 1998
and California Housing. We have run it for the maximum
number of examples possible, which in this case was 3000
for the three datasets (after trying with 1000, 2000, 3000,
4000, etc.). The 3000 examples were chosen at random
from the training data.
We have run the methods for 3 different quantile values for
each dataset: 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9. The results are shown in
tables 2, 3, 4 and 5.
In terms of running time, it is clear that the linear method is
the most efficient and that the kernel method is inefficient.
Even with the number of examples limited at 3000, the kernel method takes more than one hour to run on the larger
datasets. Quanting is relatively efficient: with our choice of

classifier learners it does not take more than 8 minutes to
run with 100 classifiers even on the larger datasets. In terms
of the quantile loss, Quanting-J48 is clearly the best performer for the Adult and California Housing datasets. The
kernel method and Quanting-LogReg are performing about
the same for these two datasets, while the linear method is
inferior. For the KDD-Cup 1998 dataset, the linear method
is the best for q=0.5 and q=0.9, while Quanting-J48 is the
best for q=0.1. This can be explained by the fact that there
is a strong linear correlation between the label and one
of the features in this dataset, which is well-captured by
the linear quantile regression but not so easily captured by
Quanting and by the kernel method. Finally, for the Boston
Housing dataset, the best method depends on the particular
value of q but the linear method is performing consistently
worse than the others.
In terms of the percentage of examples for which the prediction exceeds the actual value, all the methods come close
to desired value (the same as q) in most of the cases. But
we can observe that the linear method is consistently close,
while the kernel method shows the largest deviations.
To give an idea of how the Quanting algorithm progresses
as we add more classifiers, in figure 2 we plot the quantile
loss as a function of the number of classifiers for the Adult
and Boston Housing datasets (q = 0.9). For comparison,
we also plot the values of the quantile loss for the linear
and kernel methods as horizontal lines in the picture. It is
clear that Quanting converges very fast. In both cases, the
convergence occurs with about 50 classifiers.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a reduction from quantile regression to classification. Theoretically, we are now able to
quantify the regret of quantile regression under a quantile
loss in terms of the error rate of a base classifier. In practice,
this means that we can apply classifier learning methods to
solve quantile regression problems, which appear very often in real-world applications. Our experiments show that
the Quanting reduction is efficient in terms of computational time and performs well compared to existing quantile
regression methods.
